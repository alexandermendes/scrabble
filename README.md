# Scrabble

I couldn't find a decent free online version, so decided to make one. Written as
a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, backed by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Just a little pet project to
keep me occupied during Covid-19 times.

## Development

To run the application locally you will need to setup a (free) Firebase project.

- Create a [new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
and [register a web app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#register-app).
- Copy the Firebase config object to the root of this repo as `firebase-web-config.json`, for example:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "<your-api-key>",
  "authDomain": "<your-auth-domain>",
  "projectId": "<your-project-id>",
  "storageBucket": "<your-storage-bucket>",
  "messagingSenderId": "<your-message-sender-id>",
  "appId": "<your-app-id>"
};
```

- Enable [email link (passwordless sign-in) authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/email-link-auth).
- Provision a [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) database.
- [Generate a private key](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk),
copy the JSON file to the root of the repo and rename to `private-key.json`.
- Run `firebase use --add` and select your project (choose any alias you like).
- Run `yarn firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` to apply the database riles.

You should now be able to bring the application up with `yarn dev` and visit it
at http://localhost:3000.

Note that if you want to hit the application at `127.0.0.1` instead you will
need to whitelist the domain in the Firebase console.
