# Scrabble

I couldn't find a decent free online version, so decided to make one. Written as
a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, backed by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Just a little pet project to
keep me occupied during Covid-19 times.
